  <h2>Happy Valentine’s Day 💕</h2>

  <p>
  Happy Valentine’s Day to the girl who accidentally became my favorite person… 
  and now refuses to leave my mind for even five minutes.<br><br>

  First of all, how dare you be this cute?<br><br>

  You just walked into my life, acted normal, smiled a little, talked sweetly… 
  and now I’m out here smiling at my phone like I’ve completely lost control. 
  This is clearly your fault.<br><br>

  You’re unfairly adorable.<br>
  Unfairly sweet.<br>
  Unfairly good at making me miss you.<br><br>

  And don’t think I haven’t noticed the way you act innocent sometimes. 
  You know exactly what you’re doing. One smile and suddenly my entire mood changes. 
  One message and I forget what I was even stressed about.<br><br>

  You’ve become my comfort and my favorite distraction at the same time. 
  And honestly? I wouldn’t change that for anything.<br><br>

  I love how you tease me.<br>
  I love how you pretend you’re not soft.<br>
  I love how you act strong but still care so deeply.<br>
  And I love that you’re mine.<br><br>

  Yes. Mine. I said it.<br><br>

  You have this effect on me that I can’t even explain properly. 
  It’s not just attraction. It’s not just affection. 
  It’s something calmer and deeper… but also mixed with “wow she’s dangerously cute.”<br><br>

  If loving you this much is dramatic, then fine — I’m dramatic.<br><br>

  And just so you know…<br><br>

  If you keep being this pretty, this kind, and this sweet, 
  I might have to officially complain. Because it’s getting impossible 
  to not fall for you more every single day.<br><br>

  So on this Valentine’s Day, here’s the truth:<br><br>

  I love you.<br>
  I love your smile.<br>
  I love your vibe.<br>
  I love your energy.<br>
  And I love the way you make my world feel a little warmer.<br><br>

  Stay cute. Stay sweet.<br>
  And maybe… don’t look too good around other people 😌<br><br>

  And here’s the part you should never forget —<br><br>

  No matter who’s around, no matter what changes, no matter how time moves…<br><br>

  You’ll always be the girl my heart chose first.<br><br>

  Happy Valentine’s Day, my favorite person 💕

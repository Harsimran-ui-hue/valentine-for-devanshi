    <p>
      Happy Valentine’s Day to the girl who accidentally became my favorite person… and now refuses to leave my mind for even five minutes.

First of all, how dare you be this cute?

You just walked into my life, acted normal, smiled a little, talked sweetly… and now I’m out here smiling at my phone like I’ve completely lost control. This is clearly your fault.

You’re unfairly adorable.
Unfairly sweet.
Unfairly good at making me miss you.

And don’t think I haven’t noticed the way you act innocent sometimes. You know exactly what you’re doing. One smile and suddenly my entire mood changes. One message and I forget what I was even stressed about.

You’ve become my comfort and my favorite distraction at the same time. And honestly? I wouldn’t change that for anything.

I love how you tease me.
I love how you pretend you’re not soft.
I love how you act strong but still care so deeply.
And I love that you’re mine.

Yes. Mine. I said it.

You have this effect on me that I can’t even explain properly. It’s not just attraction. It’s not just affection. It’s something calmer and deeper… but also mixed with “wow she’s dangerously cute.”

If loving you this much is dramatic, then fine — I’m dramatic.

And just so you know…

If you keep being this pretty, this kind, and this sweet, I might have to officially complain. Because it’s getting impossible to not fall for you more every single day.

So on this Valentine’s Day, here’s the truth:

I love you.
I love your smile.
I love your vibe.
I love your energy.
And I love the way you make my world feel a little warmer.

Stay cute. Stay sweet.
And maybe… don’t look too good around other people 😌

And here’s the part you should never forget —

No matter who’s around, no matter what changes, no matter how time moves…

You’ll always be the girl my heart chose first.

Happy Valentine’s Day, my favorite person 💕
